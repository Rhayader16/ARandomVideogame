# Cyberpunk Trivia Escape

A videogame about trivia, an escape in a cyberpunk style

## What is it?

This project is about creating a simple video game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Throughout the project, I practiced DOM manipulation and array manipulation,
as well as managed some user interaction by presenting riddles and collecting answers.

## About the Game:

I implemented an array of objects within an object that contains all the questions and answers for the game, categorized accordingly.
Once the game starts, the user must provide the correct answer to a riddle, which is generated by shuffling the content of the array, within a limited time frame.
After every three correct answers, the game progresses in the storyline and changes the category, presenting another set of three random riddles.
